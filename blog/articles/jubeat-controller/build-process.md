The build process took around 4 weeks, this wasn't constant working but a few hours each night after work and a few weekends. I had a few nights and a weekend off due to burn out but 4 weeks was the rough completion time.

This post will be split into 2 separate sections:
- [Building of the base unit](#buildingofthebaseunit)
- [Building of the controller](#buildingofthecontroller)

Building the base will include the process of designing and planning out the base of the arcade machine include the PC to run the software. Building the controller will be how I designed the top panel that would control the game.
