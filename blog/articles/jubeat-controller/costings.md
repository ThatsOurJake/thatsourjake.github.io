The costings, as mentioned a brand new jubeat cabinet was around $1000 which is around £820. Below I will list all the prices in both GBP and USD. I will also break it down into different sections for both materials and tools. At the beginning of this project I had zero tools and all them had to be bought throughout the project.

| Cost of | GBP | USD |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tools | £490 | $599 |
| Materials | £350 | $428 |
| - | - | - |
| Total | £840 | $1027 |

Time taken was around 4 weeks.

As we can see the pricing despite being approximations do add up to the same price as buying a brand new arcade machine, however if I had the tools already it would have been cheaper by more than half the price of a new machine. I will also say the learning time I got from this is not measurable and hopefully the skills learnt in this project will influence future projects.
