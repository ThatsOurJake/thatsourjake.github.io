        <div class="mt-2">
          <p>When starting this project I didn't expect to end up down the rabbit hole I did, I was aware of companies who made arcade controllers for Japanese arcade games and I was naive to think I could just buy a cabinet. Both of these are technically right but for jubeat it's a little harder, there was a controller by a company called <a href="https://www.dj-dao.com/">DJ Dao</a> who I was familiar with their work but not by direct name, however this controller has been long discontinued and I couldn't find any for sale online. I then looked at buying a cabinet, most cabinets are imported into the US and these looked to set me back over a $1000 which at the beginning of this project I wasn't prepared for. I also didn't have room for a full cabinet, didn't want to take the chance it'd survive the trip and most importantly the price still being over $1000.</p>
<p>So the next logical step for me was to see if I could find a way of building my own controller and using an <em>emulator</em> to get a close experience.</p>
<p>I found a few good sources within my research <em>which I've also archived in the wayback if the below links don't work</em></p>

</ul>
<p>The above links are to various sources I used within my research, these were people either making their own Jubeat controllers and documenting their progress (like I am) or breakdowns of the DJ Dao controller which inspired my final design. I also created a mood board of various different Jubeat controller designs that later inspired my final product.</p>
<p>Next the software, again I won't go into this as it's a very grey area but again <a href="https://davidobot.net/2020/05/03/jubeat-pc">this post</a> was very helpful in searching, I used duckduckgo as the results yielded better than Google due to my region being UK and a lot of these articles are written in Japanese.</p>
<p>Now there was one final piece I had to workout, how do I learn electronics‚Ä¶ That's right, I have minimal experience with electronics and zero experience with manufacturing. How I overcame these can be found in the <a href="./build-process">Build process</a> article.</p>
